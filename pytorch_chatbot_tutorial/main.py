######################################################################
# In this tutorial, we explore a fun and interesting use-case of recurrent
# sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie
# scripts from the `Cornell Movie-Dialogs
# Corpus <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__.
#
# Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence
# research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including
# customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often
# powered by retrieval-based models, which output predefined responses to
# questions of certain forms. In a highly restricted domain like a
# company’s IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are
# not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to
# carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is
# a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning
# boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google’s `Neural
# Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__, which marks
# a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In
# this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch.

# To start, Download the data ZIP file
# `here <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html>`__
# and put in a ``data/`` directory under the current directory.
#
# After that, let’s import some necessities.

# Run Model
# ---------
#
# Finally, it is time to run our model!
#
# Regardless of whether we want to train or test the chatbot model, we
# must initialize the individual encoder and decoder models. In the
# following block, we set our desired configurations, choose to start from
# scratch or set a checkpoint to load from, and build and initialize the
# models. Feel free to play with different model configurations to
# optimize performance.

# Run Evaluation
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To chat with your model, run the following block.
#

# Set dropout layers to eval mode
encoder.eval()
decoder.eval()

# Initialize search module
searcher = GreedySearchDecoder(encoder, decoder)

# Begin chatting (uncomment and run the following line to begin)

# That’s all for this one, folks. Congratulations, you now know the
# fundamentals to building a generative chatbot model! If you’re
# interested, you can try tailoring the chatbot’s behavior by tweaking the
# model and training parameters and customizing the data that you train
# the model on.
